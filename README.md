# 👋 Hey, I'm Sagar Maheshwary!

### 🚀 Senior Backend Engineer | Microservices | DevOps | Distributed Systems

I specialize in designing and scaling **high-performance, distributed backend systems**. With **6 years of hands-on experience**, I’ve led architecture design and development for real-time and high-traffic systems, built on **modern backend stacks**, **DevOps tooling**, and **cloud-native infrastructure**.

Currently, I’m a **Senior Backend Engineer** at **Next Generation Innovations**, where I work across microservices, infrastructure, and system design — scaling APIs to millions of daily requests and enabling production-grade observability and resilience.
